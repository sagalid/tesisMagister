In this chapter we will perform an analysis of the results obtained in the multiple experiments. The analysis will allow us to obtain information regarding the original algorithm and compare it with the improved algorithm. In the same way we will compare the results with those obtained by other metaheuristics.

\subsection{Comparison of results}
