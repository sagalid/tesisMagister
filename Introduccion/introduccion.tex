Every process has a potential to be optimized. the vast majority of companies is involved in solving optimization problems every day. Indeed, many challenging applications in science and industry can be formulated as optimization problems.\\

Metaheuristics are a branch of optimization in computer science and applied mathematics that are related to algorithms and computational complexity theory. metaheuristics are raising a large interest in diverse technologies, industries, and services since they proved to be efficient algorithms in solving a wide range of  complex real-life optimization problems in different domains.\\

The instantiation of an metaheuristic requires to choose among a set of different possible components and to assign specific values to all free parameters. The author refer to such an instantiation as a configuration, which corresponds to a crucial point in the resolution of the SCP \cite{DBLP:conf/gecco/BirattariSPV02}.\\

The SCP is a well-known mathematical problem, which tries to cover a set of needs at the lowest possible cost. SCP is very important in practice, as it has been used to model a large range of problems like scheduling, manufacturing, service planning, information retrieval, among others.\\

In an attempt to resolve the SCP, a variation of Harmony Search metaheuristic in binary domain  was designed. The main goal is to find a global optimal solution, experimentation using SCP instances from the OR-library \cite{citeulike:921349}. The experiments shows that the developed algorithm generates good solutions for each instance.

\subsection{Main goal}
Solving the SCP using the Binary Global-Best HS metaheuristic algorithm. 

\subsection{Specific objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item Solve the SCP with the BGBHS metaheuristic and compare the results with benchmark of Beasley	
%Solve the SCP with the HS metaheuristic and compare the results of unicost SCP using the same technique
\item Introduce new operators that make the results more close to the global optimum.
\item Search nearest optimal solutions to problems in the SCP.
\item Compare and analyze the results using different resolution strategies.
\end{itemize}
