Every process is potentially optimizable. The vast majority of companies is involved in solving optimization problems every day \cite{DBLP:books/daglib/0022645}. Indeed, many challenging applications in science and industry can be modelled as optimization problems.\\

Metaheuristics are a branch of optimization in computer science that applie mathematics related to algorithms and computational complexity theory. Metaheuristics are raising a large interest in diverse technologies, industries, and services since they proved to be efficient algorithms in solving a wide range of  complex real-life optimization problems in different domains.\\

The instantiation of a metaheuristic requires to choose among a set of different possible components and to assign specific values to all free parameters. Instantiations are defined, by the author, as a beginning configuration, and its relevance turns crucial on solving the SCP. \cite{DBLP:conf/gecco/BirattariSPV02}.\\

The SCP is a well-known mathematical problem, which tries to cover a set of needs at the lowest possible cost. SCP is very important in practice, as it has been used to model a large range of problems like scheduling, manufacturing, service planning, information retrieval, among others.\\

In an attempt to solve the SCP, a variation of Harmony Search metaheuristic in binary domain  was designed. This method has been tested using SCP instances from the OR-library \cite{citeulike:921349} and this results have shown that the developed algorithm generates good solutions for each instance.

\section{Main goal}
