In this thesis, we propose a Binary Global-Best Harmony Search (BGBHS)  Algorithm to solve different instances of the Set Covering Problem (SCP). The SCP belongs to the $\mathcal{N} \mathcal{P}$-\textit{hard} class problems, and has become a classic combinatorial optimization problem due to its many practical applications. In this document we consider applying  BGBHS and Modified BGBHS supported in adaptive adjustment of probability parameter $p$ in the Bernoulli trials when the harmonies are created. The different results presented in this thesis show that our algorithm is a good alternative at a low cost to solve the SCP.\\
